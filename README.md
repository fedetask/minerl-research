# Minerl Research Project
This project will be my attempt at the MineRL competition. It is also my research project at
KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

## Content:
- [vae/](vae/): A Convolutional Variaitonal Autoencoder implementation. I will use it to reduce
  the state space in the RL agent.  
 
 ## The MalmoEnv
 ### Coordinates
 Coordinates are always expressed in the format (x, z, y) where y is the height
 and x is the east/west axis and z is the north/south axis. X is positive in the
 east direction, z is positive in the south direction.
